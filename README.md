# Competitive-Programming
Welcome to my new repository where I will be storing everything I know about competitive programming. 
This repository contains useful c++ stl functions, but in a simplified manner. Of course, I am not going to include every stl function,
becuase you don't have to know all functions in order to solve a particular problem, that is why I will only include functions that may
make you code more readable and can save you lots of time.

I was inspired to create this repository by a very famous competitive programmer that you might be already famillar with Benjamin Qi.
You can look up his profile on github. Its' bqi343.

I will try my best to make the code in that repository clean and efficient.
